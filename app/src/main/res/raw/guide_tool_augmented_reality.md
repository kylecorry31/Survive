The Augmented Reality tool lets you see beacons and the paths of the sun and moon overlaid onto the real world.

## Camera
If you have camera permission granted, you will see a live camera feed in the background. If you do not have camera permission granted, you will see a black background instead.

You can toggle the camera on and off by tapping the camera icon in the top-right corner of the screen.

Additionally, while the camera is active, you can adjust the zoom level using two fingers to pinch or the slider at the bottom of the screen.

## Reticle
A circular reticle is displayed in the center of your screen. You can use this to see more details about the marker you are looking at by centering it in the reticle.

## Beacons
Nearby beacons are displayed as markers on the screen. You can tap on a beacon to start navigation (See the Navigation section below). The nearby beacon radius can be adjusted in Settings > Navigation > Nearby beacon radius.

## Paths
Nearby paths are displayed below your feet. Due to GPS inaccuracy, the paths may not be perfectly aligned with the real world.

## Sun / Moon
The paths that the sun and moon will take today are displayed as markers on the screen. The sun's path is displayed in yellow and the moon's path is displayed in white. A larger marker is displayed at the current time, and will also show the moon phase. Times in the past are lighter.

If you bring the sun or moon into the reticle, you will see more details about the marker such as the time.

## Grid / Compass
A grid is displayed on the screen to help orient you. The grid is aligned with the cardinal directions and is spaced at 30 degrees. The grid line for North is highlighted in orange. The cardinal directions are displayed over the grid.

## Orientation
The orientation of your device is displayed at the top of the screen. This includes the compass bearing and the tilt angle. The Augmented Reality tool respects the True North setting found on Settings > Sensors > Compass > True North.

## Navigation
Tap on a beacon to navigate to it.

While navigating, you will see an arrow around the reticle pointing in the direction of the beacon. Move your phone toward the arrow to bring the beacon into view. When the beacon is in the reticle, the arrow will disappear.

## Sensors
The Augmented Reality tool respects the compass source in Settings > Sensors > Compass > Source. If your device does not have a gyroscope, the tool will still work but will not be as accurate and may jitter.

## Experimental
This tool is currently in experimental mode, so there may be bugs or unfinished features. If you have any feedback, please email me at trailsense@protonmail.com or visit https://github.com/kylecorry31/Trail-Sense/discussions/2099#discussioncomment-7737952 for more details.
